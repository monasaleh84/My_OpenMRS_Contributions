Mainly this would just be your one-stop shop for communication channels. Following the advice given to me for the other UI design tasks, I tried to implement a "one click" rule. All the information you need is one click away. Once you click on the site that you want to communicate (Talk, Telegram, etc), there will be a drop down with instructions on how to do so. This will have screenshots and detailed steps on how to get users where they want to go. The usual footer will be on the bottom.
