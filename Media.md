"The most number of tasks I did fell into the media category. I made a lot of helpful videos. I discovered that those Youtube videos you binge arenâ€™t as easy as you think they are to make- there are a lot of steps to make a video truly shine.

Some examples of tutorials I made were on how to build and compile OpenMRS, how to use OpenMRS Talk, and how to use the Muzima android application.

I made informational presentations about OpenMRS as well as open source development, as well as a promotional video for GCI with OpenMRS."

Taken from my blog post for GCI with OpenMRS.
