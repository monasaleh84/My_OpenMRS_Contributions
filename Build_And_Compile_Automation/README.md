This script is intended for anyone having trouble building and compiling OpenMRS.

"The first outside contribution I made really exposed me to the harsh realities of real open source development. After making my video about how to compile and build OpenMRS, it really gave me an insight of how beginners would find it difficult (after all, I was a newbie myself). I created a bash script that would automate the process and walk through the process, but when I posted it on Talk I was directed to the SDK, which was a simpler and more easy to install version of OpenMRS. Although I was a little bummed, I realized this is reality- not all of your ideas will be accepted. However, the bash script I wrote is still in my GitHub repo in case anybody doing the same task next year needs some help :)" 

Taken from my blog post for GCI with OpenMRS.
